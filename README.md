**# Sales Analysis Project ‚Äì Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**

üìå **Project Overview**

      This project performs a comprehensive Retail Sales Analysis using Python, with pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.
      The analysis helps businesses understand sales trends, customer behavior, product preferences, and profitability across regions, genders, age groups, and product   categories.
